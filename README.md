# Custom POSIX Shell Implementation üêö

A robust Unix-like shell implementation developed in C++ as part of the Advanced Operating Systems course (Monsoon 2025). This shell provides a comprehensive command-line interface with support for built-in commands, external program execution, I/O redirection, pipelines, and advanced features like autocomplete and signal handling.

## üìã Features

### Core Functionality
- **Dynamic Prompt**: Displays `username@hostname:current_directory>` format with `~` representing the shell's home directory
- **Command Chaining**: Support for semicolon-separated commands (`;`) for executing multiple commands in sequence
- **Background Processes**: Execute commands in the background using the `&` operator with PID tracking
- **Signal Handling**: Proper handling of `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT), `Ctrl+Z` (SIGTSTP), and `Ctrl+D` (EOF)

### Built-in Commands
All built-in commands are implemented without using `execvp` as per assignment requirements:

- **`cd`** - Change directory with support for `.`, `..`, `~`, and `-` flags
- **`pwd`** - Print current working directory (always shows absolute path)
- **`echo`** - Print arguments to stdout with proper space handling
- **`ls`** - List directory contents with `-a` (show hidden) and `-l` (long format) flags
- **`pinfo [pid]`** - Display process information including status, memory usage, and executable path
- **`search <filename>`** - Recursively search for files/directories in current directory
- **`history [num]`** - View command history (stores up to 20 commands, displays 10 by default)
- **`exit`** - Exit the shell gracefully

### Advanced Features
- **I/O Redirection**: Support for `<`, `>`, and `>>` operators
- **Pipelines**: Connect multiple commands using `|` operator with support for any number of pipes
- **Autocomplete**: Tab completion for commands and files/directories using readline library
- **Command History**: Persistent command history with arrow key navigation
- **Quote Handling**: Proper parsing of quoted strings and escaped characters
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all operations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The shell is designed with a modular architecture for maintainability and clarity:

### Component Responsibilities

- **`main.cpp`**: Main shell loop, signal handlers, semicolon command parsing
- **`shell.cpp`**: Command tokenization, external command execution, prompt generation
- **`builtins.cpp`**: All built-in command implementations and history management
- **`pipeline.cpp`**: Pipeline parsing and execution with proper process management
- **`redirection.cpp`**: File descriptor manipulation for I/O redirection
- **`autocomplete.cpp`**: Readline-based tab completion for commands and files

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- GNU Readline library and development headers
- Linux/Unix environment

### Installation
```bash
# Install readline development package (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

# Clone or extract the project
cd 2025202006_Assignment2

# Compile the shell
make

# Run the shell
./shell
```

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Commands
```bash
ameya@ameya-hp:~> pwd
/home/ameya/2025202006_Assignment2

ameya@ameya-hp:~> echo "Hello World"
"Hello World"

ameya@ameya-hp:~> ls -la
total 64
drwxrwxr-x 5 ameya ameya 4096 Sep 04 18:30 .
drwxrwxr-x 8 ameya ameya 4096 Sep 04 18:30 ..

- Proper signal handling with `sigaction()` for robust process control
- Background process tracking and cleanup

### Memory Management
- Careful memory allocation and deallocation to prevent leaks
- Dynamic string handling for variable-length commands
- Proper cleanup in signal handlers using async-signal-safe functions

### Error Handling
